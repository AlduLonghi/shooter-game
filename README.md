## What is this project about? 

This project consisted on building a shooter game which you can play on the browser using Phaser 3 library (JavaScript). The aim of the project was to strengthen our knowledge on Object Oriented Programming by keeping our code clean and by making use of modules. I used Webpack as my bundler and I configured it to compilate code as well as different types of files (jpg, png, wav, etc.).
