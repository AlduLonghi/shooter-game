## What is this project about? 

This project consisted of building a shooter game that you can play on the browser using Phaser 3 library (JavaScript). The project aimed to strengthen our knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming by keeping our code clean and by making use of modules. I used Webpack as my bundler and I configured it to compile code as well as different types of files (jpg, png, wav, etc.).


## Built with: 
- HTML5
- [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3)
- Vanilla JavaScript

### Tools

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/es-ES/)
- [ESlint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

**Instructions**

The player can:
- Move to the right, left, upwards, and downwards across the game's screen using arrow keys.
- Shoot enemies by pressing the Space key.
The enemies can: 
- Shoot player

The player's score will increase every time he destroys an enemy. 
The game is over when the player is shoot or touched by an enemy.
